# Latex Template
Template to create WriteUps on machines that are made both in Hack The Box, as well as for other platforms.

Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/whosstranger/Latex-Plantilla.git
```
        
When copied to your local device, you open them with the text editor both online and local but that accepts .tex extensions, it must be opened with the entire image folder to avoid failures.
